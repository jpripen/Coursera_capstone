# Coursera_capstone
This repository contains my IBM Data Science Coursera capstone project.

1- "Coursera_capstone" is the first exercise to learn to use github.

2- "Segmenting and Clustering neighborhoods in Toronto" is the final exercise of the third week of the capstone. The maps generated can be seen in maps.pdf.

3- "Battle of the Neighborhoods W1P1" contains the first part of the first week dedicated to the final project proper. It details the business understanding part of the capstone project according to the CRISP-DM methodology. The data understanding part is in "Battle of the Neighborhoods W1P2".

4- The full project (rest of CRISP-DM methodology, a report with the insights collected from the data analysis and a brief executive presentation) will be published soon.
